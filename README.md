# TweetSpeak
Here is an example of rapid prototyping focusing on how data can be arranged on a screen.


This image was used to demonstrate how twitter analytics can be arranged to best fit the customer's needs. Using a universal
sidebar, data can be grouped in any style that the user likes, this creates a very effective UX scheme.

Nothing but an image here, this never left the UX planning stage. It was only used for a school project.
